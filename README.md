# Sketch i18n
Sketch i18n enables you to generate translation files for a page and translate it. It acts in a non-destructive way so you can easily undo your changes later.

## Installation
1. Download the repository from this [link](https://github.com/kristof/sketch-i18n/archive/master.zip).
2. Grab the `Sketch i18n` folder from the ZIP.
3. In Sketch 3, select `Plugins > Reveal Plugins Folder...` from the menu bar, and put the `Sketch i18n` folder in this folder.

## Usage
### Create a translation file
1. Select a page in your Sketch file.
2. Run `1. Generate translatation file` from the plugins menu.
3. The contents of your translation file is now in your clipboard.
4. Paste the contents of your clipboard in your favorite editor.
6. Save the file as a JSON file for example: `en-US.json`.

### Translating a page
1. Select a page in your Sketch file you wish to translate.
2. Run `2. Translate page`.
3. Select the JSON translation file for that page.
4. The current page has been copied and translated.
